# Tetris NC2021 group project (group 15)

## Run instructions
The experiments can be run by executing `optimizedGA.py`, `baselineGA.py` and `EA_NES_script.py`. Make sure to comment out the experiment you want to run.

Results are placed in the `*_results` folders. These can be plotted using the `plot*.py` scripts. Make sure to give a proper filename filter as argument and an experiment number/ID.
